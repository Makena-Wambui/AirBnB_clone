Inline styling : when we use the style attribute within a HTML Element.
For example:
<header style="color: #f00;">

To refer to a CSS file within a HTML Document, use link element in head element plus 'rel' and 'href' attibutes.
I used a relative url for the images that is the logo and icon in the images folder.

The section element is used to divide the content into logical sections or subsections.

The button HTML element is an interactive element that can be clicked by a user to perform an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog
Example: <button type="button">Click Me!</button>

There are two main types of HTML lists:
1. unordered lists (ul) and 
2. ordered lists (ol).
Unordered lists display the items with bullets, while ordered lists display the items with numbers or letters.

The li tag defines a list item.
The li tag is used inside ordered lists(ol), unordered lists (ul), and in menu lists (menu).

The CSS flex property is a shorthand property for:
-> flex-grow
-> flex-shrink
-> flex-basis
The flex property sets the flexible length on flexible items.
If the element is not a flexible item, the flex property has no effect.
