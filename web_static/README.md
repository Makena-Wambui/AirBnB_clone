Inline styling : when we use the style attribute within a HTML Element.
For example:
<header style="color: #f00;">

To refer to a CSS file within a HTML Document, use <link> in <head> plus rel and href attibutes.
I used a relative url for images ie logo in the images folder.

The button HTML element is an interactive element that can be clicked by a user to perform an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog
Example: <button type="button">Click Me!</button>

There are two main types of HTML lists: unordered lists (<ul>) and ordered lists (<ol>). Unordered lists display the items with bullets, while ordered lists display the items with numbers or letters.

The <li> tag defines a list item.
The <li> tag is used inside ordered lists(<ol>), unordered lists (<ul>), and in menu lists (<menu>).
